        <h2 id="about me">About me</h2> 
        <p>I have over six years of experience in the crypto space and have spent the last two years working in the NFT/web3 industry. I have a proven track record of successfully building projects from scratch and have worked with some of the most prominent influencers in the NFT community with portfolios valued at over $1 million.</p>
            <p>As a co-founder of Royal Fools project with a volume of over $1 million, I have gained invaluable experience in managing a team of 13 people, including designers, developers, community managers, and copywriters. Currently, I am working on two projects, ensuring that I am able to dedicate the necessary time and attention to each one.</p>
            <p>My experience in the stock market as both a private trader and a broker company employee, along with my additional professional education in stock trading, has given me the skills needed to successfully make analysis of the market.</p>
